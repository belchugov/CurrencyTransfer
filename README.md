CurrencyTransfer
================

CurrencyTransfer test page

* Write your code in a way that it will scale in the future. Not a “one off”
* Use best practices wherever you can
* Add some additional functionality to the previous task like
    * Implement refresh quote button functionality
    * Each time quote is refreshed, increase the provider’s rates with a variable amount between 0.01 and 0.05
    * Implement ‘book' functionality - and include some time delay from server in doing this
    * Implement overlay while booking
    * Show a simple booking confirmed page afterwards that says “Trade booked with: BROKER_NAME"
* Make the timer a directive with starting seconds
